I've been working on an open source project to bring better validation to Angular's reactive forms. In this post we'll take a look at how to use it, why I created it and the problems it aims to solve.

### What is ngErrors?

If you're familiar with AngularJS (1.x) then you've likely stumbled across ngMessages. It's a really tidy form errors module that allows you to declaratively add errors to your templates using a switch-statement style approach.

ngErrors is my stab at the beginning of achieving similar results using Angular (v2 and onwards), with a little more ease of use, less directives and making use of observables.

#### Problem to solve

The problem that ngErrors aims to solve is the template side of adding validation messages to your templates. It's specficially designed in a way to make things easy.

We'll boot off this demo with this component code:

```js
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  
  form: FormGroup;
  
  constructor(
    private fb: FormBuilder
  ) {}
  
  ngOnInit() {
    this.form = this.fb.group({
      username: ['', [Validators.required]],
      password: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(5), Validators.maxLength(12)]]
    });
  }
  
}
```

Nice and simple, two form controls with a few validation rules. Then, the template:

```html
<form [formGroup]="form" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
      
  <input type="text" formControlName="username">
  <div>
    <div>
      Username is required
    </div>
  </div>

  <input type="text" formControlName="password">
  <div>
    <div>
      Password is required
    </div>
    <div>
      5 characters minimum, 12 characters maximum
    </div>
  </div>
  
</form>
```

Looks clean, let's then add their conditional triggers:

```html
<form [formGroup]="form" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
      
  <input type="text" formControlName="username">
  <div>
    <div 
      *ngIf="form.get('username').hasError('required') && form.get('username').touched && form.get('username').dirty">
      Username is required
    </div>
  </div>

  <input type="text" formControlName="password">
  <div>
    <div 
      *ngIf="form.get('password').hasError('required') && form.get('password').touched && form.get('password').dirty">
      Password is required
    </div>
    <div 
      *ngIf="(
        form.get('password').hasError('minlength') || form.get('password').hasError('maxlength')
      ) && form.get('password').touched && form.get('password').dirty">
      5 characters minimum, 12 characters maximum
    </div>
  </div>
  
</form>
```

In the words of Ron Burgundy - that escalated quickly.

Wouldn't it be nice to add this behaviour in just a few simple steps? With ngErrors you can! Here's the exact same example above using ngErrors:

```html
<form [formGroup]="form" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
      
  <input type="text" formControlName="username">
  <div ngErrors="username">
    <div ngError="required" [when]="['dirty', 'touched']">
      Username is required
    </div>
  </div>

  <input type="text" formControlName="password">
  <div ngErrors="password">
    <div ngError="required" [when]="['dirty', 'touched']">
      Password is required
    </div>
    <div [ngError]="['minlength', 'maxlength']" [when]="['dirty', 'touched']">
      5 characters minimum, 12 characters maximum
    </div>
  </div>
  
</form>
```

It took me a while to get the design of this API to what I'd consider a clean and readible solution. Let's dive into some further explanations as to how each piece works.

### ngErrors

ngErrors requires reactive forms and a form control to use the directive on.

#### ngErrors directive

Taking this example:

```html
<input type="text" formControlName="username">
```

We have the `formControlName` with a value of `"username"`. To kick off ngErrors all we need to do is pass the value into it:

```html
<input type="text" formControlName="username">
<div ngErrors="username">
  
</div>
```

This will then tell ngErrors to look for status changes for that particular form control, as well as props such as "dirty", "pristine", "touched" - and error states such as "required" and friends. It also supports custom validators and async validators.

#### ngError directive

Next, ngErrors requires an "ngError" - a single validation message you wish to display:

```html
<input type="text" formControlName="username">
<div ngErrors="username">
  <div ngError="required">
    Password is required
  </div>
</div>
```

The `ngError` directive accepts a string or array of values to then match against their particular error, giving us three possible syntaxes:

```html
<div ngError="required">
  Password is required
</div>
<div [ngError]="'required'">
  Password is required
</div>
<div [ngError]="['required', 'minlength']">
  Password is required
</div>
```

> When using the array syntax, you'll need to remember to `[]` data bind the values.

#### ngError #when

The `when` directive is the controller of visibility rules. Ideally we don't want to display messages at runtime without user interaction so we can hook into `"touched"` or similar to await user interaction:

```html
<input type="text" formControlName="username">
<div ngErrors="username">
  <div ngError="required" when="touched">
    Password is required
  </div>
</div>
```

This also supports a string as well as array syntaxes for multiple conditions:

```html
<div ngError="required" when="touched">
  Password is required
</div>
<div ngError="required" [when]="'touched'">
  Password is required
</div>
<div ngError="required" [when]="['touched', 'dirty']">
  Password is required
</div>
```

#### Dynamic errors

With ngErrors you can also dynamically render out your messages:

```js
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <form [formGroup]="form" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
      <input type="text" formControlName="username">
      <div ngErrors="person.username">
        <div 
          *ngFor="let error of errors" 
          [ngError]="error.name" 
          [when]="error.rules">
          {% raw %}{{ error.text }}{% endraw %}
        </div>
      </div>
    </form>
  `
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  errors = [
    { name: 'required', text: 'This field is required', rules: ['touched', 'dirty'] },
    { name: 'minlength', text: 'Min length is 5', rules: ['dirty'] }
  ];
  //...
}
```

### Live demo

### Installing it

You can check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/UltimateAngular/ngerrors) for further documentation.

To install in your project is super simple:

```bash
yarn add @ultimate/ngerrors

# OR
npm i @ultimate/ngerrors
```

From there, you'll just include it in your `@NgModule` and off you go:

```js
import { NgErrorsModule } from '@ultimate/ngerrors';

@NgModule({ imports: [ NgErrorsModule ] })
export class AppModule {}
```

And you're good to go!

### Summing up

I'm sure this is just the beginning of the library, but I think it's headed in a good direction to achieve easy validation with Angular's reactive forms. Hope you make use of it!
